Installation Instructions:
-------------------------

Look at PORTING to see if there are any hints for your platform.

Edit "config.h" to set which "SET" method you will be using.
  If you get errors about symbols not found during the link process,
  and the symbols are stuff like "setuid" or similar, you chose the wrong
  one.

Edit config.h to set any other configuration options, such as log file 
location, etc.

Edit "cgiwrap.c" to set which #include files are needed for your platform.
  You should only have to change these if you get an error compiling that
  says the header file could not be found.  

Type "make"

Copy cgiwrap executable to your servers cgi-bin directory

Hardlink or symlink nph-cgiwrap, nph-cgiwrapd, cgiwrapd to cgiwrap in the 
 cgi-bin directory.

# THIS STEP MUST BE PERFORMED WHILE LOGGED IN AS "root"
Make cgiwrap owned by root, executable by all, and setuid.
	eg. chown root cgiwrap
	chmod 4755 cgiwrap
