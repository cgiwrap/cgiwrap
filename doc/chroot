                      CGIWrap - Chroot Implementation
     _________________________________________________________________

   Note  -  This  facility is for expert administrators only, cgi scripts
   will not work AT ALL if you don't do this right.
     _________________________________________________________________

   The  chroot  facility  in  cgiwrap  is  built on a loopback filesystem
   approach.   What  this  means  is  -  cgiwrap  expects  an  equivalent
   filesystem  structure  inside  the  chrooted  area  as is outside. The
   prefix  specified  with  --with-chroot=PATH should point to the top of
   your chrooted area.

   Within     the     chrooted     area,    you    should    place    any
   executables/libraries/tools  that  you  want available to cgi scripts.
   For  the  user data within the filesystem I suggest you use a loopback
   NFS  mount. Is suggest using the nosuid and nodev options on the mount
   for additional protection.

   For  optimum  protection, you might also consider using a loopback NFS
   mount  for  the top level of the chroot area as well, mounted with the
   'ro' mount option. This will prevent ANY changes to that filesystem.

   Note,  this is not as secure as some chroot facilities, but it is more
   secure  than  the  basic cgiwrap setup. For additional security, it is
   recommended that user home directories have NO world/other permissions
   set.
