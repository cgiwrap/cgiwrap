                       CGIWrap - Chroot Implementation
     __________________________________________________________________

   Note - This facility is for expert administrators only, cgi scripts
   will not work AT ALL if you don't do this right.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The chroot facility in cgiwrap is built on a loopback filesystem
   approach. What this means is - cgiwrap expects an equivalent filesystem
   structure inside the chrooted area as is outside. The prefix specified
   with --with-chroot=PATH should point to the top of your chrooted area.

   Within the chrooted area, you should place any
   executables/libraries/tools that you want available to cgi scripts. For
   the user data within the filesystem I suggest you use a loopback NFS
   mount. Is suggest using the nosuid and nodev options on the mount for
   additional protection.

   For optimum protection, you might also consider using a loopback NFS
   mount for the top level of the chroot area as well, mounted with the
   'ro' mount option. This will prevent ANY changes to that filesystem.

   Note, this is not as secure as some chroot facilities, but it is more
   secure than the basic cgiwrap setup. For additional security, it is
   recommended that user home directories have NO world/other permissions
   set.
