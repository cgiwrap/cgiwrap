   Excerpt (750-751):
          A better solution to the problem of deciding which user a script
          runs as when multiple people have CGI access is the CGIWrap
          program. CGIWrap, which is included on the CD that accompanies
          this book, is a simple wrapper that executes a CGI script as the
          user that owns the file instead of the user that the server
          specifies. This simple precaution leaves the script owner
          responsible for the damage it can do.

          For instance, if the user "joanne" owns a CGI script that's
          wrapped in CGIWrap, the server will execute the script as user
          "joanne." In this way, CGIWrap acts like a setuid bit but has
          the added advantage of being controlled by the Web server rather
          than the operating system. That means that anybody who sneaks
          through any security holes in the script will be limited to
          whatever "joanne" herself can do-the files she can read and
          delete, the directories she can view, and so on.

          Because CGIWrap puts CGI script authors in charge of the
          permissions for their own scripts, it can be a powerful tool not
          only to protect important files owned by others, but to motivate
          people to write secure scripts. The realization that only their
          files would be in danger can be a powerful persuader to script
          authors.

   Comments:
          The book is pretty good, at least in the copy I got, they say
          that CGIwrap is included on the CD, but I can't find it
          anywhere.
