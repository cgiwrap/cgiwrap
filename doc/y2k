                         CGIWrap - Year 2000 Issues
     _________________________________________________________________

   As far as I know, cgiwrap is as y2k compliant as the C libraries on the
   machine it was compiled on. The only place it uses a date is in it's logging
   routine, and it uses the "ctime" and "time" functions.

   Worst  case  scenario,  presuming  the  system  libraries are terribly
   non-compliant, is just disable the printing of the time and date in the
   logging routine.
