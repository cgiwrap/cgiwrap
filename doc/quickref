                        CGIWrap - URL Quick Reference
     __________________________________________________________________

   In all of the below examples, replace SERVER with the hostname and port
   of your webserver. Replace USER with your userid, and replace SCRIPT
   with the name of the script that is located in your cgi-bin directory.

   In the below URLs you can replace "cgiwrap" according to the following:

   cgiwrap
          Normal script execution

   cgiwrapd
          Executes script, but returns debugging information, also is
          returned preformatted, so you can see the source that the script
          is outputting.

   nph-cgiwrap

   nph-cgiwrapd
          Same as above, except you sometimes need to use this if your
          script outputs binary data, such as an image counter script.

  Standard Installation of CGIWrap

   Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/cgi-bin/ directory

     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT

   Or the old deprecated syntax of:
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT

  Password Protected Installation of CGIWrap

   Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/auth-cgi-bin/ directory

     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT

   Or the old deprecated syntax of:
     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT

  Other Options

   With certain other web servers, the above syntax can sometimes be
   shortened depending on how the local administrator has set up the
   server. For example, some site support a URL syntax similar some of the
   following:
     * http://SERVER/~USER/SCRIPT.cgi
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/~USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/~USER/cgi-bin/SCRIPT.cgi

   The administrator can look at the tricks document for some ideas on
   configuring the server.

  Notes

   The syntax examples above using user= and script= are carryovers from
   the original versions of CGIwrap, and are not really needed. I highly
   reccomend you don't use them, the other examples are much clearer and
   easier to use.
