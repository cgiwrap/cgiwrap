                       CGIWrap - URL Quick Reference
                                      
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   In all of the below examples, replace SERVER with the hostname and
   port of your webserver. Replace USER with your userid, and replace
   SCRIPT with the name of the script that is located in your cgi-bin
   directory.
   
   In the below URLs you can replace "cgiwrap" according to the
   following:
   
   cgiwrap
          Normal script execution
          
   cgiwrapd
          Executes script, but returns debugging information, also is
          returned preformatted, so you can see the source that the
          script is outputting.
          
   nph-cgiwrap
          
   nph-cgiwrapd
          Same as above, except you sometimes need to use this if your
          script outputs binary data, such as an image counter script.
          
  Standard Installation of CGIWrap
  
   Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/cgi-bin/ directory
   
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT
       
  Password Protected Installation of CGIWrap
  
   Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/auth-cgi-bin/ directory
   
     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT
       
  Notes
  
   The syntax examples above using user= and script= are carryovers from
   the original versions of CGIwrap, and are not really needed. I _highly_
   reccomend you don't use them, the other examples are much clearer and
   easier to use.
