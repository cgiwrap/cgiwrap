                       CGIWrap - URL Quick Reference
     _________________________________________________________________

   In  all  of  the  below examples, replace SERVER with the hostname and
   port  of  your  webserver.  Replace USER with your userid, and replace
   SCRIPT  with  the  name  of the script that is located in your cgi-bin
   directory.

   In  the  below  URLs  you  can  replace  "cgiwrap"  according  to  the
   following:

   cgiwrap
          Normal script execution

   cgiwrapd
          Executes  script,  but  returns  debugging information, also is
          returned  preformatted,  so  you  can  see  the source that the
          script is outputting.

   nph-cgiwrap

   nph-cgiwrapd
          Same  as  above,  except you sometimes need to use this if your
          script outputs binary data, such as an image counter script.

  Standard Installation of CGIWrap

   Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/cgi-bin/ directory

     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT

   Or the old deprecated syntax of:
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT

  Password Protected Installation of CGIWrap

   Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/auth-cgi-bin/ directory

     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT

   Or the old deprecated syntax of:
     * http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT

  Other Options

   With  certain  other  web  servers,  the above syntax can sometimes be
   shortened  depending  on  how  the  local administrator has set up the
   server.  For  example,  some site support a URL syntax similar some of
   the following:
     * http://SERVER/~USER/SCRIPT.cgi
     * http://SERVER/cgi-bin/~USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT
     * http://SERVER/~USER/cgi-bin/SCRIPT.cgi

   The  administrator  can  look at the tricks document for some ideas on
   configuring the server.

  Notes

   The  syntax examples above using user= and script= are carryovers from
   the  original versions of CGIwrap, and are not really needed. I highly
   reccomend  you don't use them, the other examples are much clearer and
   easier to use.
