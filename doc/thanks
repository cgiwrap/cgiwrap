     __________________________________________________________________

   The following are some people who have made significant contributions
   or suggestions to cgiwrap. If you notice someone who is missing, or I
   forgot about you, please let me know and I'll add you to the list.

   Tuc/TTSG Internet Services, Inc:
          Sponsored most of the vhosting and script authorization changes
          in 3.8.0 release. Changes are highly useful for ISP
          installations of cgiwrap where execution is through apache
          handlers to make the use of cgiwrap as transparent as possible
          to the customer.
