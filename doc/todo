                               CGIWrap - To Do
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here are some things that still need to be done and ideas for possible
   future things to do.

     * Fixing the PATH_TRANSLATED support
     * HTML version of cgiwrapd instead of text/plain
     * More flexible approach to user directory mapping - rewrite file,
       mapping dir to user instead of user to dir
     * Limiting script execution based on load average.
     * Allow setting any environment variable from CGIwrap
     * finish the request info section of the error output
     * use SERVER_ADMIN and other http variables.
     * if you disable httpd user checking - you need to make sure to
       define the installation group to be the group that the server is
       running as - and be sure and restrict permissions.
     * Continue creating global context for storage of data
