   Here are some things that still need to be done.
     * Fixing the PATH_TRANSLATED support
     * HTML version of cgiwrapd instead of text/plain
     * More flexible approach to user directory mapping - rewrite file,
       mapping dir to user instead of user to dir
     * Limiting script execution based on load average.
     * Allow setting any environment variable from CGIwrap
     * use SERVER_ADMIN
     * add a "--with-cgiwrap-admin=email-address" option
     * add a "--with-cgiwrap-docs=URL" option
     * add a "--with-local-docs=URL"
     * if you disable httpd user checking - you need to make sure to
       define the installation group to be the group that the server is
       runnig as
