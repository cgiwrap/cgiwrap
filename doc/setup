                         CGIWrap - User Instructions
     __________________________________________________________________

   The following are instructions for setting up your account to be able
   to use cgiwrap to execute cgi scripts. It is assumed that you are
   familiar with writing CGI scripts and writing HTML documents for the
   WWW.

   In the following instructions, the following information is assumed:
     * UserID: joe
     * Home Directory: /users/joe
     * CGI Directory: /users/joe/public_html/cgi-bin
     * Name of Script: script.pl
     * Web Server: www.domain.com

   If you do not already have a cgi-bin directory set up, create one:
     * cd ~joe
     * mkdir public_html
     * mkdir public_html/cgi-bin

   If you are using AFS, you will need to set the AFS permissions on the
   directories. See Use of CGIwrap with AFS for details on the necessary
   permissions.

   Install the script into the cgi-bin directory, and set the proper
   execution permissions on the file.
     * cp script.pl ~joe/public_html/cgi-bin/script.pl
     * chmod 755 ~joe/public_html/cgi-bin/script.pl

   The script is executed using the following URL:
     * http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/joe/script.pl

   If you wish to see debugging output for your CGI, specify cgiwrapd
   instead of cgiwrap, as in the following URL:
     * http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrapd/joe/script.pl

   If the script is an nph- style script, you will need to run it using
   the following URL's:
     * http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/nph-cgiwrap/joe/script.pl
     * http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/nph-cgiwrapd/joe/script.pl
