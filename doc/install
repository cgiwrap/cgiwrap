                    CGIWrap - Installation Instructions
                                      
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Quick Installation
  
   Look at the notes to see if there are any hints for your platform.
          
   Issue "./configure --help" to find out the various configuration
          options. You will need to specify some of them. At the very
          least, you will want to specify "--with-httpd-user=USERID".
          
   Type "./configure <options>" with whatever options you need..
          
   Type "make"
          
   If you specified the installation directory in the options, you can
          type "make install" to do all the following steps.
          
   Copy cgiwrap executable to your servers cgi-bin directory
          
   Make cgiwrap owned by root, executable by all, and setuid. (_Note:_
          This step must be performed while logged in as "root")
          
          
          chown root cgiwrap
          chmod 4755 cgiwrap
          
   Hardlink or symlink nph-cgiwrap, nph-cgiwrapd, cgiwrapd to cgiwrap in
          the cgi-bin directory.
          
          
          ln [-s] cgiwrap cgiwrapd
          ln [-s] cgiwrap nph-cgiwrap
          ln [-s] cgiwrap nph-cgiwrapd
          
   You can, if you wish, install it with less permissive permissions.
          (Eg. 4750) But if you do this, make sure that the group of
          cgiwrap is the same as the group that the server runs as.
          
   *VERY IMPORTANT* - Do NOT allow any user to run scripts directly out
          of the main cgi-bin directory, as this will allow them to use
          cgiwrap to run any of the other users scripts.
          
  Configuration Options
  
   The following are options available with the 'configure' command.
   Items in boldface are highly recommended. Defaults can be seen by
   issuing './configure --help' or by looking at the 'config.h' file
   after you have run 'configure'.
   
   At an absolute minimum, you will probably want to specify the
   '--with-install-dir' and '--with-httpd-user' options.

  Password Protected Installation
  
   The following are pecial additional instructions for installing a copy
   of cgiwrap that allows users to create access controlled scripts. For
   this to work, you will need to have a single common password file that
   will be used by all authenticated scripts.
   
   Re run configure, specify "public_html/auth-cgi-bin" instead of
          "public_html/cgi-bin" for the cgi directory.
          
   Type make.
          
   Create a new server cgi-bin directory called "auth-cgi-bin", and
          install this new copy of cgiwrap into that directory the same
          way you installed it into the cgi-bin directory. (4 copies, and
          set permissions). You will now be able to use the url:
          http://server/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap...
          
   To enable access control, place a .htaccess or equivalent file in the
          auth-cgi-bin directory where cgiwrap is located, that requires
          authentication to get at any file in that directory, but will
          allow any valid user to get through.
          
   Now, your users can simply check: 1. That their script was executed by
          them (eg. check the real uid of the script to make sure someone
          else wasn't running it by hand) 2. That the REMOTE_USER
          environment variable contains a user name that they want to
          allow to access the script.

  Supplementary Configuration
  
   If you enabled the access file checking, you need to make sure and
   create the necessary files.
   
   If you enabled the user directory rewriting feature, you need to
   create the configuration file that you specified in the configure run.
