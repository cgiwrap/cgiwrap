                          CGIWrap - Usage with AFS
     __________________________________________________________________

   CGIwrap will work with AFS, with at least the following directory
   permissions:

                       Dir        User/Group   Permissions
                  ~             system:anyuser      l
                  ~/public_html system:anyuser      l
                  ~/public_html system:anyuser     rl

   If you are running httpd authenticated as an AFS userid, you can
   replace system:anyuser above with that userid.

   If you are using CGIWrap with AFS I'd suggest making sure to enable the
   AFS support in the configure script (--with-afs). This automatically
   creates a PAG for any script that is launched, that way if the script
   klogs, it won't affect the server or other scripts. When using cgiwrap
   with AFS based accounts, you need to keep in mind that scripts are run
   un-authenticated. This means that any files that are accessed will be
   accessed as system:anyuser. In general, this means that the script will
   not have write access to your directory.
