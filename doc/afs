     _________________________________________________________________

   CGIwrap will work with AFS, with at least the following directory
   permissions:

                       Dir        User/Group   Permissions
                  ~             system:anyuser      l
                  ~/public_html system:anyuser      l
                  ~/public_html system:anyuser     rl

   If you are running httpd authenticated as an AFS userid, you can
   replace system:anyuser above with that userid.

   If you are using CGIWrap with AFS I'd suggest making sure to enable
   the AFS support in the configure script (--with-afs). This
   automatically creates a PAG for any script that is launched, that way
   if the script klogs, it won't affect the server or other scripts. When
   using cgiwrap with AFS based accounts, you need to keep in mind that
   scripts are run un-authenticated. This means that any files that are
   accessed will be accessed as system:anyuser. In general, this means
   that the script will not have write access to your directory.
