Installation Instructions:
-------------------------

Look at NOTES to see if there are any hints for your platform.

Run the Configure script.

Type "make"

Copy cgiwrap executable to your servers cgi-bin directory

Hardlink or symlink nph-cgiwrap, nph-cgiwrapd, cgiwrapd to cgiwrap in the 
 cgi-bin directory.

# THIS STEP MUST BE PERFORMED WHILE LOGGED IN AS "root"
Make cgiwrap owned by root, executable by all, and setuid.
	chown root cgiwrap
	chmod 4755 cgiwrap


---- 
Special additional instructions for installing a copy of cgiwrap that 
allows users to create access controlled scripts. For this to work, you 
will need to have a single common password file that will be used by all 
authenticated scripts.

Re run configure, specify "public_html/auth-cgi-bin" instead of 
"public_html/cgi-bin" for the cgi directory.

Type make.

Create a new server cgi-bin directory called "auth-cgi-bin", and install 
this new copy of cgiwrap into that directory the same way you installed 
it into the cgi-bin directory. (4 copies, and set permissions). You will 
now be able to use the url:  http://server/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap...

To enable access control, place a .htaccess or equivalent file in the 
auth-cgi-bin directory where cgiwrap is located, that requires 
authentication to get at any file in that directory, but will allow any 
valid user to get through.

Now, your users can simply check: 1. That their script was executed by 
them (eg. check the real uid of the script to make sure someone else 
wasn't running it by hand) 2. That the REMOTE_USER environment variable 
contains a user name that they want to allow to access the script.
