   These are some of the changes that have occured in CGIwrap from
   version to version.
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  New in version 3.6.2:
  
     * Fixed the !logfd check. Thanks to Alexander Wolgast for pointing
       this out.
     * Added support for reporting rusage/return code after executing
       script.
     * Changed logging to use close-on-exec flag of file descriptor, so
       it can be left open for reporting rusage if enabled.
     * Added support for reporting approximate elapsed execution time of
       a cgi script.
       
  New in version 3.6.1:
  
     * Fixed the UserInFile routine. It broke cause I forgot to remove
       newlines.
       
  New in version 3.6:
  
     * Removed check for ./ in the path of the script. The check for ../
       is still there. There doesn't seem to be any need for this check
       as it appears to be harmless. It is being removed to allow for
       users with "./" in their home dir (for chrooting with wuftpd) to
       be able to use cgiwrap.
     * Added code to optionally prevent script execution if the script is
       group or world writable. I cannot make the check for world
       writable forced on, since on my site using AFS, the permission
       bits aren't used, and some scripts might be marked as world
       writable. Can't break user scripts without a major hassle.
     * Added code to optionally check if script file is a symbolic link.
       Of course, the script dir itself could still be a symbolic link.
     * Changed to GNU autoconf for configuration
     * Makefile now supports 'install' target with --install-path is
       specified with configure.
     * Support added for setting PATH and TZ environment variables before
       executing script
     * Support added for setting a bunch of different RLIMIT_ parameters
       before executing script, as well as allowing the administrator to
       set the limits with the --with-rlimit-*=value option to configure.
     * Error messages are now more verbose and output in HTML if
       possible.
     * Support for calling script using system() has been removed as it
       is not really needed for anything, and just slows things down.
     * Fixed malloc() error check in GetUserDir routines
     * Fixed race condition with permissions and opening of log file
     * initgroups() and setgroups() support now enabled by default
     * Eliminated buffer overrun in error message about chmod'ing script.
       Thanks to Duncan Simpson (dps@io.stargate.co.uk)
     * Added --with-minimum-uid option
     * Fixed the subdirectory restrict option. (Thanks to Jeffery Chow )
       for pointing this out and for testing the fix.
     * Added CondenseSlashes routine to eliminate doubled and trailing
       slashes
     * Added SafeMalloc routine to eliminate the need to check malloc
       result throughout the code.
     * Changed tardist target to touch all files and directories so that
       a consistent time stamp is reached. This should eliminate spurious
       calls to autoheader when building cgiwrap.
     * Added in code to configure.in for the various information options
       such as local-site-url, local-contact-phone, etc.
     * Added fcntl.h include, needed by open(). Problem reported by Seth
       Chaiklin . Also fixed quoting in the configure.in related to log
       file.
     * Finished splitting up logging functions and changes to use the
       Context structure.
     * Minor changes to the makefile, including telling it to use the
       CFLAGS, and improving the tardist target.
     * Moved extra flag stuff for AFS into it's own section and only run
       it if needed for AFS support.
     * Not sure why, but 3.6 works with AIX 4, 3.5 did not.
     * Cleaned up Makefile, finished support for building in a separate
       directory from the source, added a 'dep' target using depend.awk
       from mutt distribution.
     * Fixed problem with CHECKHOST/CHECKHOSTS typos.
     * Added support for using "*" with checkhost support to restrict ALL
       userids from being accessed from that host. (*@x.x.x.x/y.y.y.y)
     * Made 'no way to change uids' a compile time error with #error
     * Fixed bug with ALLOWFILE define in util.c.
       
  New in version 3.5:
  
     * Fixed strerror checking in Configure script and util.c for systems
       without strerror, can now use strerror, sys_errlist, perror, or
       just errno.
     * Major documentation overhaul, create all HTML based docs
     * Added option (defaulting to yes) to correctly set the
       PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable.
     * Fixed bug with the configure script and the use_system option. It
       would cause a preprocessor error if the system call was not found.
     * Cleaned up various things with the Configure script
     * Changed file prompting to allow using ~ paths.
       
  New in version 3.4:
  
     * Fixed typo "&" instead of "&&" in setgroups stuff
     * Added cgiwrap.aliases option to rewrite home dirs of users.
     * Moved entire cgiwrap source build tree to CVS, will make tracking
       changes easier.
     * CGIwrap now changes directories to the directory the script is
       located in before executing the script. Before, it always just
       changed to the main CGI directory. This behavior is only different
       if you were using scripts in subdirectories.
     * Changed style of cgiwrap.allow, cgiwrap.deny files to be the same
       as cron's allow/deny files.
       
  New in version 3.3:
  
     * Added support for attaching a label to syslog log messages.
     * Added code to rewrite the PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable.
       
  New in version 3.24:
  
     * Added support for logging to syslog.
       
  New in version 3.23:
  
     * Setgroups was being used no matter what you said in configure -
       fixed
     * Problem with undefined variables in Log call for subdirectories -
       fixed
     * Removed declaration of sys_errlist, and errno in util.c, since I
       don't think they were necessary. And they were causing problems on
       some architectures.
     * Added in user contributed host address checking code
     * Upgraded to using dist-3.0 PL60 for building the Configure script.
     * Separated initgroups() and setgroups() checks into two separate
       defines, and improved documentation in configure script for these
       options.
       
  New in version 3.22:
  
     * argv[0] is now automatically changed to the name of the script
       that is being executed
       
  New in version 3.21:
  
     * Rlimit defines weren't set properly when rlimit not available -
       fixed
     * The optimizer/debugger flag wasn't being used in the makefile --
       fixed
     * Defaults for checks (y/n) were not being set - fixed
       
  New in version 3.2:
  
     * MAJOR code cleanup and simplification. The code should be ALOT
       easier to read and understand.
     * Fixed the problem in the Makefile on certain architectures with
       the $(var) not being escaped properly. This should solve problems
       with Linux machines and BSD machines that I know of.
     * Changes way PATH_INFO is modified, CGIwrap will now correct
       SCRIPT_NAME for ?user=USER&script=SCRIPT type requests as well as
       /user/script type requests.
     * Subdirectories are now supported for both types of requests
     * Debugging output has been condensed and is a little easier to
       read.
     * Documentation has been reworked, it should be a little easier to
       use.
     * Fixed prototypes for all the functions in the cgiwrap source.
     * Removed a few unnecessary routines
     * Changed "mystrcpy" to be "strdup", and is compiled only if the
       current architecture does not have strdup available in it's
       standard library.
       
  New in version 3.11:
  
     * Fixed incorrectly indented # directives that were causing problems
       with some machines.
       
  New in version 3.1:
  
     * Added CONF_ALLOWFILE and CONF_DENYFILE options.
     * Added logging of REMOTE_USER and a status message to the log file
     * Added an unsupported directory for user contributed scripts and
       add-ons
     * Restructured logic for which 'set' method gets used.
     * Removed option to not check if gid changed, it was an oversight
       that this was left in. There isn't any case I know of that you
       wouldn't want to check this.
     * Moved id setting routines into util.c
     * Added new source file for allow/deny code.
     * Removed some error output that didn't make sense (system error
       messages that were getting returned when I issued a regular
       cgiwrap error)
     * Added a 'remake' target to the makefile which does a clean, then a
       Configure -S, then a make all to rebuild he entire binary. This is
       useful if you have multiple config.sh files (eg. you're building
       for several setups from the same dir)
       
  New in version 3.0:
  
     * Set up Configure scripts for CGIwrap
     * Renamed many of the config options to make more consistent
     * Rearranged directory structure of CGIwrap distribution
     * Removed "CONF_SANITIZE" option, it is always on now.
     * Removed "CONF_CHECK_UID" option, it is always on now.
     * Removed "CONF_FORCE_DEBUG" option, and "CONF_DEBUG_BY_NAME"
       option, cgiwrap automatically does debugging output by name now.
     * Added info about setting up an access-controlled cgiwrap which
       allows users to control access to their scripts.
     * Renamed DEBUG to CONF_DEBUG to solve a compile problem with some
       systems wanting to add -DDEBUG to CFLAGS.
       
  New in version 2.7:
  
     * Added HTTPD_USER and CHECK_HTTPD_USER to verify that cgiwrap is
       being called by the server. This is for (access to scripts)
       security, it doesn't affect system security any.
     * Added AFS PAG support
       
  New in version 2.6:
  
     * Moved rlimit call into new subroutine SetLimits
     * Changed exec call to an execv and passed argv to support argument
       passing This will only work correctly for scripts called with no
       other arguments... Eg, must use "cgiwrap/user/script?" syntax
       
  New in version 2.5:
  
     * Fixed problem with not correctly falling back from PATH_INFO
     * Added SETUID_SETEUID option for setting UID's
     * Added checks to make sure effective ugid changed as well as real.
       
  New in version 2.4:
  
     * Fixed incorrect exec call, added null at end.
       
  New in versoin 2.3:
  
     * Fixed location of setgroups() call
     * Added INSTALL file and fixed PROMO that was old.
       
  New in version 2.2:
  
     * More debug outpt for environment variables
     * Option to check exec bit on script and error msg if not set
       
  New in version 2.1:
  
     * Fixed ~ bug
     * Added PATH_INFO and SCRIPT_NAME rewrite code
     * Added SETGROUPS option to config
     * Added RLIMIT option to config
       
  New in version 2.0:
  
     * Added support for PATH_INFO specification of user/script
     * Added stderr redirection to stdout
     * Added option for doing debugging output by cmd name
     * Added option to use exec or system calls
       
  New in version 1.0:
  
     * Everything! This is the first public distribution.
