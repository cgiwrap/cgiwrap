  Administrative Questions
  
   I am getting the error "Can't ... ". How can I fix this?
          CGIwrap needs to be installed set-uid to root. Log in as root,
          change to the server's cgi-bin directory, and issue the
          commands:
          

        chown root cgiwrap
        chmod 4755 cgiwrap

   I am getting the error "setgroups() failed!". What is wrong?
          This occurs when CGIwrap is unable to set auxilliary groups.
          Auxillliary groups are groups that a user in a member of (in
          /etc/group), that are not the user's primary group (in
          /etc/passwd). Two things you can do here are to make sure
          CGIwrap is installed correctly (has to be setid root to be able
          to set auxilliary groups.), or disable setting auxilliary
          groups (answer no to the question when running Configure.).
          
  User Questions
  
   I am getting a 500 Server Error, how can I debug my script?
          CGIwrap supports a debugging mode which can help to debug
          scripts. To use it, call CGIwrap via the URL
          http://.../cgiwrapd/... instead of http://.../cgiwrap/....
