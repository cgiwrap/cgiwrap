  Administrative Questions

   I am getting the error about the server userid.
          CGIwrap needs to be configured with the userid that your web
          server is running as. For apache based servers, this is the
          userid that is listed on the "User" line in httpd.conf. You
          specify this when configuring CGIWrap using the
          --with-httpd-user option.

   I am getting the error "Can't ... ". How can I fix this?
          CGIwrap needs to be installed set-uid to root. Log in as root,
          change to the server's cgi-bin directory, and issue the
          commands:

        chown root cgiwrap
        chmod 4755 cgiwrap

   How do I use CGIwrap with server side includes
          This is not supported by all web servers, but with Apache, use:

        <!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/user/script...."-->

          One of the problems is that this often is a security hole unless
          you can enable server side exec/virtual include only of
          executables that are in ExecCGI capable directories. Some people
          have made patches that will allow this to work. Ask on the list
          for details.

   I am getting the error "setgroups() failed!". What is wrong?
          This occurs when CGIwrap is unable to set auxilliary groups.
          Auxilliary groups are groups that a user is a member of in
          /etc/group, that are not the user's primary group in
          /etc/passwd. Two things you can do here are to make sure CGIwrap
          is installed correctly (has to be setuid root to be able to set
          auxilliary groups.), or disable setting auxilliary groups.

   ld.so.1: /net/bin/perl: fatal: /usr/lib/libintl.so.1: can't map file:
          errno=12
          This indicates that you installed cgiwrap with resource limiting
          (with rlimit support) but the limits are set too low. There
          isn't enough memory for perl to load. Keep in mind that unix
          applications usually use alot of virtual memory, even though
          their resident size is small.

   How do I get PHP to work with cgiwrap
          Here is an informal how-to I wrote after I set up cgiwrap and
          php recently. Much thanks goes to Nathan Nuelinger for the
          pointing out the decisive step of compiling with
          --enable-discard-path.

          Download cgiwrap and set that up. I already had cgiwrap set up
          to wrap cgi scripts, but I did upgrade to the latest version.
          Get this working first with some simple cgi script tests. (BTW:
          Options you may find helpful include --with-cgi-dir and
          --with-httpd-user)

          Download the latest version of php and configure it as a cgi
          binary, not as a module. Basically, if you run ./configure with
          no options, php will be compiled as a cgi binary. (To set it up
          as an apache module, which you don't want to do if you want to
          wrap your scripts, you have to explicitly say ./configure
          --with-apache.)

          Before you compile php, however, and this is crucial, configure
          php with the option --enable-discard-path which allows you to
          move the php binary out of the web tree and into /usr/local/bin
          (which adds security), but more importantly it allows you to use
          php with cgiwrap properly.

          To summarize, you need to run ./configure --enable-discard-path
          plus any other options you may desire, and place the php binary
          in /usr/local/bin.

          Finally, you need the #!/usr/local/bin/php line at the very top
          of every php script you write. Then call the php script with
          cgiwrap exactly as you would call a cgi script. For example:

          http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/cgiwrap//

          Let me know if you have any questions. Brian

  User Questions

   I am getting a 500 Server Error, how can I debug my script?
          CGIwrap supports a debugging mode which can help to debug
          scripts. To use it, call CGIwrap via the URL
          http://.../cgiwrapd/... instead of http://.../cgiwrap/....

   I am getting the error execv() failed
          This generally results from either having the wrong path to
          perl, or having control-M's after the path to perl. This is
          usually a result of uploading the script in binary mode instead
          of ascii. You can fix this by re-uploading the script in ascii
          mode, or using vi/perl/etc. to get rid of the control-M's in the
          file.
          For some situations, simply adding " -- " to the end of the
          first line of the script will cause the error to go away,
          sometimes not.

   How do I use cgiwrapd on a Cobalt RaQ?
          cgiwrapd is still there, it just isn't directly obvious how to
          use it. If you normally call your script as

          http://www.site1.com/test.cgi

          you can call it as

          http://www.site1.com/cgiwrapDir/cgiwrapd/test.cgi

          to run it under cgiwrapd. Basically they ScriptAlias
          "cgiwrapDir" to the directory where cgiwrap is installed.
