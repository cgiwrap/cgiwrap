  Administrative Questions
  
   I am getting the error about the server userid.
          CGIwrap needs to be configured with the userid that your web
          server is running as. For apache based servers, this is the
          userid that is listed on the "User" line in httpd.conf. You
          specify this when configuring CGIWrap using the
          --with-httpd-user option.
          
   I am getting the error "Can't ... ". How can I fix this?
          CGIwrap needs to be installed set-uid to root. Log in as root,
          change to the server's cgi-bin directory, and issue the
          commands:
          
        chown root cgiwrap
        chmod 4755 cgiwrap

   How do I use CGIwrap with server side includes
          This is not supported by all web servers, but with Apache, use:
          
        <!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/user/script...."-->

          One of the problems is that this often is a security hole
          unless you can enable server side exec/virtual include only of
          executables that are in ExecCGI capable directories. Some
          people have made patches that will allow this to work. Ask on
          the list for details.
          
   I am getting the error "setgroups() failed!". What is wrong?
          This occurs when CGIwrap is unable to set auxilliary groups.
          Auxilliary groups are groups that a user is a member of in
          /etc/group, that are not the user's primary group in
          /etc/passwd. Two things you can do here are to make sure
          CGIwrap is installed correctly (has to be setuid root to be
          able to set auxilliary groups.), or disable setting auxilliary
          groups.
          
   ld.so.1: /net/bin/perl: fatal: /usr/lib/libintl.so.1: can't map file:
          errno=12
          This indicates that you installed cgiwrap with resource
          limiting (with rlimit support) but the limits are set too low.
          There isn't enough memory for perl to load. Keep in mind that
          unix applications usually use alot of virtual memory, even
          though their resident size is small.
          
  User Questions
  
   I am getting a 500 Server Error, how can I debug my script?
          CGIwrap supports a debugging mode which can help to debug
          scripts. To use it, call CGIwrap via the URL
          http://.../cgiwrapd/... instead of http://.../cgiwrap/....
          
   I am getting the error execv() failed
          This generally results from either having the wrong path to
          perl, or having control-M's after the path to perl. This is
          usually a result of uploading the script in binary mode instead
          of ascii. You can fix this by re-uploading the script in ascii
          mode, or using vi/perl/etc. to get rid of the control-M's in
          the file.
          For some situations, simply adding " -- " to the end of the
          first line of the script will cause the error to go away,
          sometimes not.
