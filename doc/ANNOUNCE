CGIwrap 2.6 is a upgrade to CGIwrap 2.5 that fixes the passing of command 
line arguments to scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those who are not familiar with CGIwrap - it is a small package I have
written which provides a more secure front end for system administrators
to allow their user's to access cgi scripts on a unix http server.

CGIwrap performs a series of security checks on the scripts before
executing them. Any script execution is done as the user who owns the
script, and all script accesses are logged. 

CGIwrap changed both the real and effective UIDs before running any script.

The level of security, etc. can be adjusted in the source. CGIwrap is
known to work on A/UX, HPUX, Solaris, Linux, and OSF/1. It should work on
almost any unix system.

CGIwrap is now available at:
   ftp://ftp.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgi/cgiwrap/

It also might be available at:
   ftp://pluto.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgi/cgiwrap
   ftp://ftp.rollanet.org/pub/cgi/cgiwrap

Other CGI scripts I have written, and some scripts that have been 
modified to work with cgiwrap more easily are available from:
   ftp://ftp.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgi

More information, and some sample user instructions on how to use cgiwrap
are available at:

Program:    cgiwrap
Author:     Nathan Neulinger

Purpose:    Gateway program for HTTPD web server which allows general
            user access to CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts, without
            having to compromise the security of the server itself.
           
           
Reason for making CGIWrap available:
====================================

Currently, with the way the web server is set up, and with the way the
code for httpd is written, there are two ways to provide a user with the
ability to execute CGI scripts from their web pages.

    1.  Give the user in question write access to the main CGI-BIN
        directory for the web server. 
              
    2.  Create a directory specifically for that user to use for CGI
        scripts, and alter the configuration of the http server to allow 
        scripts to be executed from that directory. 
       
There are problems with both of these approaches however. 

    1. The script is run with the privileges of the account which httpd
    is run as. This means that you still have to implicity trust anyone
    who has CGI script access - because their script can access

    2. Any email which is sent in the script (which is a common way to use
    the output of a form) is sent from the user that the http server is
    running as.

    3. In the second method, every time a new user wants to use CGIs, a
    system administrator would have to change the configuration of the 
    server. 


Explanation of how CGIWrap works:
=================================

'cgiwrap' solves that problem, as well as eliminates any need for
changing the configuration of the http server when another user also
wants to be able to use CGI scripts.

Cgiwrap's function is to act as a gateway for all requests that come into
the http server to execute users' CGI scripts. It is called with a URL
similar to the following:

    http://servername/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=XXXXX&script=YYYYYY
         XXXXX is the name of the user who owns the script
        YYYYY is the name of the script to execute
        
User scripts are located in a subdirectory "cgi-bin" of the user's
public_html directory. After processing the URL and extracting the name
of the user and the name of the script from the URL, it logs the
request into a log file, and then changes it's UID to match that user.

    Each request is logged with the following information:
    USER    SCRIPT    REMOTE-IP    REMOTE-HOST   URL-USED

For example, the Student Council current has a form available on their
web page which allows students to submit comments and suggestions to
the student council through Mosaic or lynx. They have a script called
"stuco-mail.pl", which is located in "/users/delta/public_html/cgi-bin"
on pluto. The following URL is used to execute that script (in response
to a user clicking the submit button on the suggestion form).

    http://pluto.cc.umr.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=delta&script=stuco-mail.pl
    
Cgiwrap's security features are configurable at compile time. Options can
be turned on/off depending on the particular configuration desired.


Configurable Options:
=====================
    Filename to use for log file.
        Default:  /usr/adm/cgiwrap.log
        
    Name of subdirectory (relative to users home dir) to use for CGIs.
        Default:  public_html/cgi-bin
        
        
Installation requirements:
==========================
    The cgiwrap binaries must be setid root to enable 'cgiwrap' to change the
    UID and GID when executing user's scripts.
        
        
Security Options:
=================
Note: An Error condition in the following means that cgiwrap will
display an error message on the clients screen, and WILL NOT execute
the CGI script in question, it will immediately exit with an error code.

    * Error if the UID and GID weren't successfully changed.
        This is to add a double layer of protection in case there is a 
        problem changing the UID or GID.
        
    * Error if username specified does not match the owner of the script.
    * Error if group of script does not match the group of user specified.
        Prevents a user from making a symbolic or hard link to 
        someone else's cgi script, or to a program that they do not own.
    
    * Error if the SetUID bit on the script is set.
    * Error if the SetGID bit on the script is set. 
        Prevents the script running with anyone else's privileges but the
        person who owns it.
    
    * Error if script is located in a subdirectory of cgi-bin.
        Prevents creating subdirectories in the cgi-bin directory for
        storing scripts. 


Problems with CgiWrap:
======================

Problem:
    Users that are not familiar with CGI might not be able to write
    scripts that are completely secure.

Response:
    If the user writes an insecure script, the only account that will be
    affected is that particular users account. 
    
    A answer to this could also be for the computer center to provide
    several standard scripts (one or two) that are known to be secure,
    for standard types of form responses such as emailing the results
    of a filled out form to the user who owns the script.



Problem:
    Users could write a script that displayed the /etc/passwd file to the
    remote user. (Or similar)

Response:
    Users can do this anyway. Either by making a symbolic link to that
    file in their public html directory, or simply by making a copy of
    the file and putting it in their directory.

    Users will be informed, if they use cgiwrap, that every transaction via
    cgiwrap is logged, and that they will be responsible for what their
    scripts do.
