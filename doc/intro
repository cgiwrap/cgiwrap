                           CGIWrap - Introduction
     _________________________________________________________________

   CGIWrap  is  a  gateway  program  that allows general users to use CGI
   scripts  and  HTML forms without compromising the security of the http
   server.  Scripts are run with the permissions of the user who owns the
   script.  In  addition,  several  security  checks are performed on the
   script, which will not be executed if any checks fail.

   CGIWrap is used via a URL in an HTML document. As distributed, cgiwrap
   is   configured   to  run  user  scripts  which  are  located  in  the
   ~/public_html/cgi-bin/ directory.
