          Cgiwrap is a gateway program that allows general users to
          use CGI scripts and HTML forms without compromising the
          security of the http server. Scripts are run with the
          permissions of the user who owns the script. In addition,
          several security checks are performed on the script, which
          will not be executed if any checks fail.

          Cgiwrap is used via a URL in an HTML document. As
          distributed, cgiwrap is configured to run user scripts which
          are located in the ~/public_html/cgi-bin/ directory.

          The following are instructions for setting up your
          directories and scripts for execution on UMR's test web
          server.

          The instructions are intended for use with AFS. It is
          assumed that you are familiar with writing CGI scripts and
          writing HTML documents for the WWW. If not, see one of the
          URL's listed at the bottom of this man page for more
          information.

          For this example, the script is "email.pl". The user id is
          "joeminer".

          Create the directories needed to hold html documents and
          scripts

          1. cd

          2. mkdir public_html

          3. mkdir public_html/cgi-bin

          Set permissions on directories

          4. fs setacl . system:anyuser l

          5. fs setacl public_html system:anyuser rl

          6. fs setacl public_html/cgi-bin system:anyuser rl

          Install the script into the cgi-bin directory, along with
          any related files.

          The script is executed using the following URL:

          http://www.umr.edu:2520/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=joeminer&script=email.pl

          When using cgiwrap with AFS based accounts, you need to keep
          in mind that scripts are run un-authenticated. This means
          that any files that are accessed in AFS directories are
          accessed as "system:anyuser". This is important when
          considering how your script will return data to you.
          Currently, the easiest way to return data to the user is to
          email the results of the script. Obviously, this only
          applies to scripts that are supposed to be used for
          submitting data - scripts that simply return information to
          the web client are not affected by this.

          Cgiwrap can be used with forms, but it is suggested that you
          use the "POST" method. If you use the get method, you will
          need to add two hidden fields to your form containing the
          user and script name. "GET" types requests are discouraged
          in any case due to the limited amount of data that can be
          passed to the script.
