<CENTER><H2>CGIWrap - To Do</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

Here are some things that still need to be done and ideas for
possible future things to do.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Fixing the PATH_TRANSLATED support
<LI>HTML version of cgiwrapd instead of text/plain
<LI>More flexible approach to user directory mapping - rewrite file, mapping 
	dir to user instead of user to dir
<LI>Limiting script execution based on load average.
<LI>Allow setting any environment variable from CGIwrap

<LI>finish the request info section of the error output
<LI>use SERVER_ADMIN and other http variables.

<LI>if you disable httpd user checking - you need to make sure to define the 
installation group to be the group that the server is running as - and be sure
and restrict permissions.

<LI>Continue creating global context for storage of data

</UL>
