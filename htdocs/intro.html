CGIWrap is a gateway program that allows general users to use CGI
scripts and HTML forms without compromising the security of the http
server. Scripts are run with the permissions of the user who owns the
script. In addition, several security checks are performed on the
script, which will not be executed if any checks fail.
<P>
CGIWrap is used via a URL in an HTML document. As distributed, cgiwrap
is configured to run user scripts which are located in the
~/public_html/cgi-bin/ directory.
