<HR><P>

In all of the below examples, replace SERVER with the hostname
and port of your webserver. Replace USER with your userid, and replace
SCRIPT with the name of the script that is located in your cgi-bin
directory.
<P>
In the below URLs you can replace "<TT>cgiwrap</TT>" according to the
following:

<DL>
	<P><DT>cgiwrap
		<DD>Normal script execution
	
	<P><DT>cgiwrapd
		<DD>Executes script, but returns debugging information, also is
		returned preformatted, so you can see the source that the script is
		outputting.
		
	<P><DT>nph-cgiwrap
	<P><DT>nph-cgiwrapd
		<DD>Same as above, except you sometimes need to use this if your
		script outputs binary data, such as an image counter script.
</DL>
	
<H3>Standard Installation of CGIWrap</H3>
Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/cgi-bin/ directory
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
	<LI>http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT
</UL>
<P>
Or the old deprecated syntax of:
<UL>
	<LI>http://SERVER/cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT
</UL>

<H3>Password Protected Installation of CGIWrap</H3>
Place your scripts in your ~/public_html/auth-cgi-bin/ directory
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/USER/SCRIPT
	<LI>http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT
</UL>
<P>
Or the old deprecated syntax of:
<UL>
	<LI>http://SERVER/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap?user=USER&script=SCRIPT
</UL>

<H3>Other Options</H3>
With certain other web servers, the above syntax can sometimes be 
shortened depending on how the local administrator has set up the server. 
For example, some site support a URL syntax similar some of the following:
<UL>
	<LI>http://SERVER/~USER/SCRIPT.cgi
	<LI>http://SERVER/cgi-bin/~USER/SCRIPT
	<LI>http://SERVER/cgiwrap/~USER/SCRIPT
	<LI>http://SERVER/~USER/cgi-bin/SCRIPT.cgi
</UL>
The administrator can look at the <A HREF="tricks.html">tricks</A> 
document for some ideas on configuring the server.
<P>
<H3>Notes</H3>
The syntax examples above using <TT>user=</TT> and <TT>script=</TT> are 
carryovers from the original versions of CGIwrap, and are not really 
needed. I <B>highly</B> reccomend you don't use them, the other examples 
are much clearer and easier to use.
