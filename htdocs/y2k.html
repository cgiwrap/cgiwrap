<HR><P>

As far as I know, cgiwrap is as y2k compliant as the C libraries on the
machine it was compiled on. The only place it uses a date is in it's 
logging routine, and it uses the "ctime" and "time" functions.
<P>
Worst case scenario, presuming the system libraries are terribly
non-compliant, is just disable the printing of the time and date in the
logging routine.
