	<P>
	<DD>More information on the mailing list is available <A 
HREF="maillist.html">here</A>.

<P><DT>How do I send a message to the mailing list?
	<DD>Any mail sent to 
		<A HREF="mailto:cgiwrap-users@lists.sourceforge.net">cgiwrap-users@lists.sourceforge.net</A>

		subscribed to the list. I will occasionally hand approve
		messages to the list if I see one from a non-subscriber, 
		but you need to subscribe to the list.

<P><DT>What is on topic for the mailing list?
	<DD>anything cgiwrap related
	<DD>use of cgiwrap with ssi/cgi/various servers/tricks/etc
	<DD>Discussion of any cgiwrap incompatibilities with other 
		scripts, etc.
	<DD>cgi security questions and issues related or not related to cgiwrap.
	<DD>Anything else that comes up that is of interest to a large

<H3><A NAME="admin">Administrative Questions</H3>
<DL>
<P><DT>I am getting the error about the server userid.
	<DD>CGIwrap needs to be configured with the userid that your 
	web server is running as. For apache based servers, this is the userid
	that is listed on the "User" line in httpd.conf. You specify this
	when configuring CGIWrap using the --with-httpd-user option.

<P><DT>I am getting the error "<TT>Can't ... </TT>". How can I fix this?
	<DD>CGIwrap needs to be installed set-uid to root. Log in as 
		root, change to the server's cgi-bin directory, and issue the commands:
<PRE>
	chown root cgiwrap
	chmod 4755 cgiwrap
</PRE>

<P><DT>How do I use CGIwrap with server side includes
	<DD>This is not supported by all web servers, but with Apache, use:
<PRE>
	&lt;!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/user/script...."--&gt;
</PRE>
	<DD>One of the problems is that this often is a security hole unless you can
enable server side exec/virtual include only of executables that are in
ExecCGI capable directories. Some people have made patches that will 
allow this to work. Ask on the list for details.

<P><DT>I am getting the error "<TT>setgroups() failed!</TT>". What is wrong?
	<DD>This occurs when CGIwrap is unable to set auxilliary groups. 
Auxilliary groups are groups that a user is a member of in /etc/group, 
that are not the user's primary group in /etc/passwd. Two things you 
can do here are to make sure CGIwrap is installed correctly (has to be 
setuid root to be able to set auxilliary groups.), or disable setting 
auxilliary groups.

<P><DT> ld.so.1: /net/bin/perl: fatal: /usr/lib/libintl.so.1: can't map file: errno=12
<DD>This indicates that you installed cgiwrap with resource limiting (with rlimit support)
but the limits are set too low. There isn't enough memory for perl to load. Keep
in mind that unix applications usually use alot of virtual memory, even though
their resident size is small.

<H3><A NAME="user">User Questions</H3>
<DL>
<P><DT>I am getting a 500 Server Error, how can I debug my script?
	<DD>CGIwrap supports a debugging mode which can help to debug 
		scripts. To use it, call CGIwrap via the URL <TT>http://.../cgiwrapd/...</TT> 
		instead of <TT>http://.../cgiwrap/...</TT>.

<P><DT>I am getting the error <TT>execv() failed</TT>
	<DD>This generally results from either having the wrong path to perl, 
		or having control-M's after the path to perl. This is usually
		a result of uploading the script in binary mode instead of ascii.
		You can fix this by re-uploading the script in ascii mode, or
		using vi/perl/etc. to get rid of the control-M's in the file.
		
	<DD>For some situations, simply adding " -- " to the end of the
	first line of the script will cause the error to go away, sometimes
	not. 

<P><DT>How do I use cgiwrapd on a Cobalt RaQ?
<DD>
cgiwrapd is still there, it just isn't directly obvious how to use it.
If you normally call your script as
<P>
	http://www.site1.com/test.cgi
<P>
you can call it as
<P>
http://www.site1.com/cgiwrapDir/cgiwrapd/test.cgi
<P>
to run it under cgiwrapd.  Basically they ScriptAlias "cgiwrapDir" to
the directory where cgiwrap is installed.
