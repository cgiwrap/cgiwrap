<P><DT>I am getting the error "<TT>Can't ... </TT>". How can I fix this?
	<DD>CGIwrap needs to be installed set-uid to root. Log in as 
		root, change to the server's cgi-bin directory, and issue the commands:
<PRE>
	chown root cgiwrap
	chmod 4755 cgiwrap
</PRE>

<P><DT>I am getting the error "<TT>setgroups() failed!</TT>". What is wrong?
	<DD>This occurs when CGIwrap is unable to set auxilliary groups. 
Auxillliary groups are groups that a user in a member of (in /etc/group), 
that are not the user's primary group (in /etc/passwd). Two things you 
can do here are to make sure CGIwrap is installed correctly (has to be 
setid root to be able to set auxilliary groups.), or disable setting 
auxilliary groups (answer no to the question when running Configure.).

<DL>
<P><DT>I am getting a 500 Server Error, how can I debug my script?
	<DD>CGIwrap supports a debugging mode which can help to debug 
		scripts. To use it, call CGIwrap via the URL <TT>http://.../cgiwrapd/...</TT> 
		instead of <TT>http://.../cgiwrap/...</TT>.
