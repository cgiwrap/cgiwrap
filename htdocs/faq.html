<DL>
<P><DT>I am getting the error "<TT>Can't ... </TT>". How can I fix this?
	<DD>CGIwrap needs to be installed set-uid to root. Log in as 
		root, change to the server's cgi-bin directory, and issue the commands:
<PRE>
	chown root cgiwrap
	chmod 4755 cgiwrap
</PRE>

<P><DT>How do I use CGIwrap with server side includes
	<DD>This is not supported by all web servers, but with Apache, use:
<PRE>
	&lt;!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/user/script...."--&gt;
</PRE>
	<DD>One of the problems is that this often is a security hole unless you can
enable server side exec/virtual include only of executables that are in
ExecCGI capable directories.

<P><DT>I am getting the error "<TT>setgroups() failed!</TT>". What is wrong?
	<DD>This occurs when CGIwrap is unable to set auxilliary groups. 
Auxilliary groups are groups that a user is a member of in /etc/group, 
that are not the user's primary group in /etc/passwd. Two things you 
can do here are to make sure CGIwrap is installed correctly (has to be 
setuid root to be able to set auxilliary groups.), or disable setting 
auxilliary groups.

<P><DT> ld.so.1: /net/bin/perl: fatal: /usr/lib/libintl.so.1: can't map file: errno=12
<DD>This indicates that you installed cgiwrap with resource limiting (with rlimit support)
but the limits are set too low. There isn't enough memory for perl to load. Keep
in mind that unix applications usually use alot of virtual memory, even though
their resident size is small.

<DL>
<P><DT>I am getting a 500 Server Error, how can I debug my script?
	<DD>CGIwrap supports a debugging mode which can help to debug 
		scripts. To use it, call CGIwrap via the URL <TT>http://.../cgiwrapd/...</TT> 
		instead of <TT>http://.../cgiwrap/...</TT>.
