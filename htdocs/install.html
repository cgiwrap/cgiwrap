<HR><P>



<H3>Quick Installation</H3>
<DL>
	<P><DT>Look at the <A HREF="notes.html">notes</A> to see if 
there are any hints for your platform.

	<P><DT>Issue "./configure --help" to find out the various
configuration options. You will need to specify some of them. At 
the very least, you will want to specify "--with-httpd-user=USERID".

	<P><DT>Type "./configure &lt;options&gt;" with whatever options you need..

	<P><DT>Type "make"

	<P><DT>If you specified the installation directory in the 
options, you can type "make install" to do all the following steps.

	<P><DT>Copy cgiwrap executable to your servers cgi-bin directory

	<P><DT>Make cgiwrap owned by root, executable by all, and setuid. 
(<B>Note:</B> This step must be performed while logged in as "<TT>root</TT>"</B>) 
	<P>
	<DD>chown root cgiwrap
	<DD>chmod 4755 cgiwrap

	<P><DT>Hardlink or symlink nph-cgiwrap, nph-cgiwrapd, cgiwrapd to 
cgiwrap in the cgi-bin directory.
	<P>
	<DD>ln [-s] cgiwrap cgiwrapd
	<DD>ln [-s] cgiwrap nph-cgiwrap
	<DD>ln [-s] cgiwrap nph-cgiwrapd

	<P><DT>You can, if you wish, install it with less permissive permissions. (Eg. 
4750) But if you do this, make sure that the group of cgiwrap is the same 
as the group that the server runs as.

	<P><DT>*VERY IMPORTANT* - Do NOT allow any non-trusted user to run 
scripts directly out of the main cgi-bin directory, as this will allow them to use
cgiwrap to run any of the other users scripts. The reason for this is that 
if they can run scripts as the same userid as the web server, they can
subvert some of cgiwrap's security checks to allow them to run other users 
scripts. I recommend not running ANY scripts on the web server directly, once
you have cgiwrap installed.

</DL>

<P>
<H3>Configuration Options</H3>
<P>
The following are options available with the 'configure' command.
Items in boldface are highly recommended. Defaults can be seen by issuing
'./configure --help' or by looking at the 'config.h' file after you have 
run 'configure'.
<P>
At an absolute minimum, you will probably want to specify the 
'--with-install-dir' and '--with-httpd-user' options.

<P><DL>
<DT>--with-perl=PATH
<DD>path to perl executable to use

<DT>--with-local-contact-name=NAME
<DD>Specify the name of the local contact

<DT><B>--with-local-contact-email</B>
<DD>Specify the local contact's email address

<DT>--with-local-contact-phone
<DD>Specify the local contact's phone number

<DT>--with-local-contact-url
<DD>Specify a URL for the local contact

<DT>--with-local-site-url
<DD>Specify a URL for this site

<DT><B>--with-local-doc-url</B>
<DD>Specify a URL for a local copy of the cgiwrap docs

<DT>--with-wall
<DD>Add the '-Wall' option for compilation with gcc, this is intended
primarily for development debugging.

<DT>--with-install-group=GROUP
<DD>group to install cgiwrap as

<DT><B>--with-install-dir=PATH</B>
<DD>path to installation directory - this should be the path to your 
server's cgi-bin directory

<DT>--with-cgi-dir=PATH
<DD>path relative to home dir for cgi scripts

<DT><B>--with-multiuser-cgi-dir=PATH</B>
<DD>define a central cgi script directory that is searched if the script
is not found in a user directory. This can be used to make a single script
available that will run as any user, however, this can be very dangerous
if you're not extremely careful designing your script. Do not enable
this unless you know what you're doing. It is not needed for normal usage.

<DT><B>--with-httpd-user=USER</B>
<DD>define what userid the web server is running as - this is required

<DT>--without-check-httpd-user
<DD>don't check to make sure cgiwrap is being run by server userid - 
this is not recommended

<DD>disable check for world writable script

<DT>--without-check-symlink
<DD>disable check for symlinked script

<DT>--with-check-shell
<DD>enable check for a valid user shell

<DT>--with-chroot=PATH
<DD>chroots script to PATH prior to script execution, requires
specific environment to be set up. See <A HREF="chroot.html">chroot docs</A>
for more details.

<DT>--with-minimum-uid=UID
<D>set the minimum uid of user that can use cgiwrap

<DT>--with-logging-syslog=LABEL
<DD>enable logging script execution to syslog

<DT>--with-logging-file=FILE
<DD>enable logging script execution to file

<DT>--without-script-subdirs
<DD>prevent users from storing scripts in subdirs

<DT>--without-redirect-stderr
<DD>don't redirect stderr to stdout in scripts

<DT>--without-initgroups
<DD>disable use of initgroups() to clear non-userid auxilliary groups

<DT>--without-setgroups
<DD>disable use of setgroups() to add userid's auxilliary groups

<H3>Password Protected Installation</H3>
<P>

The following are pecial additional instructions for installing a copy of
cgiwrap that allows users to create access controlled scripts. For this to
work, you will need to have a single common password file that will be
used by all authenticated scripts. 

<DL>
	<P><DT>Re run configure, specify "public_html/auth-cgi-bin" instead of 
"public_html/cgi-bin" for the cgi directory.

	<P><DT>Type make.

	<P><DT>Create a new server cgi-bin directory called "auth-cgi-bin", and 
install this new copy of cgiwrap into that directory the same way you installed 
it into the cgi-bin directory. (4 copies, and set permissions). You will 
now be able to use the url:  http://server/auth-cgi-bin/cgiwrap...

	<P><DT>To enable access control, place a .htaccess or equivalent file in 
the auth-cgi-bin directory where cgiwrap is located, that requires 
authentication to get at any file in that directory, but will allow any 
valid user to get through.

	<P><DT>Now, your users can simply check: 1. That their script was 
executed by them (eg. check the real uid of the script to make sure someone else 
wasn't running it by hand) 2. That the REMOTE_USER environment variable 
contains a user name that they want to allow to access the script.

</DL>



<P><HR>
<H3>Supplementary Configuration</H3>
<P>
If you enabled the access file checking, you need to make sure and create 
the necessary files.
<P>
If you enabled the user directory rewriting feature, you need to create 
the configuration file that you specified in the configure run.
