CGIwrap will work with AFS, with at least the following directory permissions:

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=50%>
	<TR><TH>Dir</TH>

		<TH>Permissions</TH></TR>
	<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT>~</TD>
		<TD ALIGN=CENTER>system:anyuser</TD>

	<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT>~/public_html</TD>
		<TD ALIGN=CENTER>system:anyuser</TD>

</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
If you are running httpd authenticated to AFS, you can replace 
system:anyuser above with that userid.
<P>
If you are using CGIWrap with AFS I'd suggest making sure to enable the
AFS PAG support in the Configure script. This automatically creates a PAG
for any script that is launched, that way if the script klogs, it won't
affect the server or other scripts. When using cgiwrap with AFS based
accounts, you need to keep in mind that scripts are run un-authenticated.
This means that any files that are accessed will be accessed as
<TT>system:anyuser</TT>. In general, this means that the script will not
have write access to your directory.
