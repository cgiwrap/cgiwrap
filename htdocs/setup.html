<p>
The following are instructions for setting up your
directories and scripts for execution on UMR's test web
server.
<P>
The instructions are intended for use with AFS. It is
assumed that you are familiar with writing CGI scripts and
writing HTML documents for the WWW. If not, see one of the
URL's listed on the <a href="internet/web_design.html">Web Page Design 
page</a>.
 <P>
<b>Note:</b> All scrips that are precompiled before use have to be
compiled on a HP-UX machine (saucer/rocket). This is because the WWW 
servers are being run on HP-UX machines.
<p>
For this example, the script is "<B>email.pl</B>". The user id is
"<B>joeminer</B>".
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create the directories needed to hold html documents and scripts
<OL>
<LI>cd
<LI>mkdir public_html
<LI>mkdir public_html/cgi-bin
</OL>
<P>
<LI>Set <B>minimal required</B> permissions on directories
<OL>
<LI>fs setacl . system:anyuser l
<LI>fs setacl public_html system:anyuser rl
<LI>fs setacl public_html/cgi-bin system:anyuser rl
</OL>
<P>
<LI>Install the script into the cgi-bin directory
<P>
<LI>Set the proper execution permissions on the file
<OL>
<LI>chmod u+rx <B>email.pl</B>
</OL>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
The script is executed using the following URL:
<BR>
http://wwwcgi.umr.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/<b>joeminer</B>/<B>email.pl</B>
<P>
If you wish to see debugging output for your CGI, specify <B>cgiwrapd</B>
instead of <B>cgiwrap</B>.
<P>
When using cgiwrap with AFS based accounts, you need to keep
in mind that scripts are run un-authenticated. This means
that any files that are accessed in AFS directories are
accessed as "system:anyuser". This is important when
considering how your script will return data to you.
<P>
Currently, the easiest way to return data to the user is to
email the results of the script. Obviously, this only
applies to scripts that are supposed to be used for
submitting data - scripts that simply return information to
the web client are not affected by this.
<P>
CGIwrap can be used in forms, just use the above URL's as the ACTION of 
the form.
