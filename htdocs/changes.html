Log of Changes to CGIwrap:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Changes since 3.4:
   Fixed strerror checking in Configure script and util.c for systems without
	strerror, can now use strerror, sys_errlist, perror, or just errno.
   Added HTML documentation
   Moved change log and others to be HTML

Changes since 3.3:
   Fixed typo "&" instead of "&&" in setgroups stuff
   Added cgiwrap.aliases option to rewrite home dirs of users.
   Moved entire cgiwrap source build tree to CVS, will make tracking
	changes easier.
   CGIwrap now changes directories to the directory the script is located
	in before executing the script. Before, it always just changed
	to the main CGI directory. This behavior is only different if you
	were using scripts in subdirectories.
   Changed style of cgiwrap.allow, cgiwrap.deny files to be the same as
	cron's allow/deny files.

Changes since 3.24:
   Added support for attaching a label to syslog log messages.
   Added code to rewrite the PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable.

Changes since 3.23:
   Added support for logging to syslog.

Changes since 3.22:
   Setgroups was being used no matter what you said in configure - fixed
   Problem with undefined variables in Log call for subdirectories - fixed
   Removed declaration of sys_errlist, and errno in util.c, since I don't 
think they were necessary. And they were causing problems on some 
architectures.
   Added in user contributed host address checking code
   Upgraded to using dist-3.0 PL60 for building the Configure script.
   Separated initgroups() and setgroups() checks into two separate 
defines, and improved documentation in configure script for these options.

Changes since 3.21:
   argv[0] is now automatically changed to the name of the script that is
being executed

Changes since 3.2:
   Rlimit defines weren't set properly when rlimit not available - fixed
   The optimizer/debugger flag wasn't being used in the makefile -- fixed
   Defaults for checks (y/n) were not being set - fixed
   
Changes since 3.11:
   MAJOR code cleanup and simplification. The code should be ALOT easier to 
read and understand.
   Fixed the problem in the Makefile on certain architectures with the $(var)
not being escaped properly. This should solve problems with Linux 
machines and BSD machines that I know of.
   Changes way PATH_INFO is modified, CGIwrap will now correct SCRIPT_NAME 
for ?user=USER&script=SCRIPT type requests as well as /user/script type 
requests.
   Subdirectories are now supported for both types of requests
   Debugging output has been condensed and is a little easier to read.
   Documentation has been reworked, it should be a little easier to use.
   Fixed prototypes for all the functions in the cgiwrap source.
   Removed a few unnecessary routines
   Changed "mystrcpy" to be "strdup", and is compiled only if the current 
architecture does not have strdup available in it's standard library.

Changes since 3.1:
   Fixed incorrectly indented # directives that were causing problems with
some machines.

Changes since 3.0:
   Added CONF_ALLOWFILE and CONF_DENYFILE options.
   Added logging of REMOTE_USER and a status message to the log file
   Added an unsupported directory for user contributed scripts and add-ons
   Restructured logic for which 'set' method gets used.
   Removed option to not check if gid changed, it was an oversight that 
this was left in. There isn't any case I know of that you wouldn't want 
to check this.
   Moved id setting routines into util.c
   Added new source file for allow/deny code.
   Removed some error output that didn't make sense (system error 
messages that were getting returned when I issued a regular cgiwrap error)
   Added a 'remake' target to the makefile which does a clean, then a 
Configure -S, then a make all to rebuild he entire binary. This is useful 
if you have multiple config.sh files (eg. you're building for several 
setups from the same dir)

Changes since 2.7:
   Set up Configure scripts for CGIwrap
   Renamed many of the config options to make more consistent
   Rearranged directory structure of CGIwrap distribution
   Removed "CONF_SANITIZE" option, it is always on now.
   Removed "CONF_CHECK_UID" option, it is always on now.
   Removed "CONF_FORCE_DEBUG" option, and "CONF_DEBUG_BY_NAME" option, 
	cgiwrap automatically does debugging output by name now.
   Added info about setting up an access-controlled cgiwrap which allows
        users to control access to their scripts.
   Renamed DEBUG to CONF_DEBUG to solve a compile problem with some systems
	wanting to add -DDEBUG to CFLAGS.

Changes since 2.6:
   Added HTTPD_USER and CHECK_HTTPD_USER to verify that cgiwrap is being
   	called by the server. This is for (access to scripts) security, it 
	doesn't affect system security any. 
   Added AFS PAG support

Changes since 2.5:
   Moved rlimit call into new subroutine SetLimits
   Changed exec call to an execv and passed argv to support argument passing
	This will only work correctly for scripts called with no other 
	arguments... Eg, must use "cgiwrap/user/script?" syntax

Changes since 2.4:
   Fixed problem with not correctly falling back from PATH_INFO
   Added SETUID_SETEUID option for setting UID's 
   Added checks to make sure effective ugid changed as well as real.

Changes since 2.3:
   Fixed incorrect exec call, added null at end.

Changes since 2.2:
   Fixed location of setgroups() call
   Added INSTALL file and fixed PROMO that was old.

Changes since 2.1:
   More debug outpt for environment variables
   Option to check exec bit on script and error msg if not set

Changes since 2.0:
   Fixed ~ bug						
   Added PATH_INFO and SCRIPT_NAME rewrite code                
   Added SETGROUPS option to config
   Added RLIMIT option to config

Changes since 1.0:                                             
   Added support for PATH_INFO specification of user/script     
   Added stderr redirection to stdout                           
   Added option for doing debugging output by cmd name          
   Added option to use exec or system calls
