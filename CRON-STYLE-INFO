      Users are permitted to use crontab if their names appear in the file
      /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow.  If that file does not exist, the file
      /usr/lib/cron/cron.deny is checked to determine if the user should be
      denied access to crontab.  If neither file exists, only root is
      allowed to submit a job.  If only cron.deny exists and is empty,
      global usage is permitted.  The allow/deny files consist of one user
      name per line.
