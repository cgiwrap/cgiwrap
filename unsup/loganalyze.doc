Hi Nathan,
        another quick hack I did was to write a little perl script to
help me analyse the cgiwrap logs. It outputs a little html document
with a table summarising each distinct script (by filename) and the
number of times it was called. Optionally (using the -t flag) it also
does a variant of find on the script to indicate what type of script
it is (to help paranoid sysadmins decide whether they should check it
for security holes or not :-)

Its usage is: 
        cgiwrap_anal [-t] [logfile]
               -t      check and display the type of each script
               logfile to be analysed if not the default

If you decide you like it and want to include it in the distribution,
you'll want to have Configure customise the location of perl, log_file
and conf_cgidir

Cheers
Lawrie
