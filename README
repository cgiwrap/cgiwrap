This is CGI-Wrap - a gateway that allows more secure user access to CGI 
programs on an HTTPd server than is provided by the http server itself.

This code may be freely copied and modified, though it may not be
Sold, Rented, Re-Released, Folded, Spindled, or Mutilated w/o contacting me
first.
 
I do ask that if you make modifications, or have any improvements that you
send them to me <nneul@umr.edu> and I will add them to the main source so
others can benefit. If you wish to re-release a modified version of this 
source, please contact me first.

An important note is, this script makes the CGI access MORE secure, but 
it does not make CGI access "secure". By it's very nature, CGI itself can 
never be 100% secure, it is always dependent on the script itself.
