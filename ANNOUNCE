(CGIwrap 2.2 improves 2.1 by adding an option to check whether the 
script's exec bit is set, and returns an error message if it is. The 
debugging output is cleaned up a bit, and the debugging routines have 
been moved into a separate source file.


For those who are not familiar with CGIwrap - it is a small package I have
written which provides a more secure front end for system administrators
to allow their user's to access cgi scripts on a unix http server.

CGIwrap performs a series of security checks on the scripts before
executing them. Any script execution is done as the user who owns the
script, and all script accesses are logged. Some of the security checks
that are performed are:

   *  if script is located in "~nneul/public_html/cgi-bin", it must be 
owned by
      nneul to be executable.

   *  The userid and groupid of the user executing the script must match 
those
      of the user who owns the script.

CGIwrap changed both the real and effective UIDs before running any script.

The level of security, etc. can be adjusted in the source. CGIwrap is
known to work on A/UX, HPUX, Solaris, Linux, and OSF/1. It should work on
almost any unix system.

CGIwrap is available at:
   ftp://pluto.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgiwrap/cgiwrap-2.2.tar

Other CGI scripts I have written, and some scripts that have been 
modified to work with cgiwrap more easily are available from:
   ftp://pluto.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgi
