(CGIwrap 2.1 is a small fix from 2.0 that fixes couple minor cosmetic bug,
and also has a couple additional options, such as setting the auxillary
groups that a process is executed with, and also an option for limiting
CPU time.)

For those who are not familiar with CGIwrap - it is a small package I have
written which provides a more secure front end for system administrators
to allow their user's to access cgi scripts on a unix http server.

CGIwrap performs a series of security checks on the scripts before
executing them. Any script execution is done as the user who owns the
script, and all script accesses are logged. Some of the security checks
that are performed are:

   *  if script is located in "~nneul/public_html/cgi-bin", it must be 
owned by
      nneul to be executable.

   *  The userid and groupid of the user executing the script must match 
those
      of the user who owns the script.

CGIwrap changed both the real and effective UIDs before running any script.

The level of security, etc. can be adjusted in the source. CGIwrap is
known to work on A/UX, HPUX, Solaris, Linux, and OSF/1. It should work on
almost any unix system.

CGIwrap is available at:
