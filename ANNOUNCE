CGIwrap 2.6 is a upgrade to CGIwrap 2.5 that fixes the passing of command 
line arguments to scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those who are not familiar with CGIwrap - it is a small package I have
written which provides a more secure front end for system administrators
to allow their user's to access cgi scripts on a unix http server.

CGIwrap performs a series of security checks on the scripts before
executing them. Any script execution is done as the user who owns the
script, and all script accesses are logged. 

CGIwrap changed both the real and effective UIDs before running any script.

The level of security, etc. can be adjusted in the source. CGIwrap is
known to work on A/UX, HPUX, Solaris, Linux, and OSF/1. It should work on
almost any unix system.

CGIwrap is now available at:
   ftp://ftp.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgi/cgiwrap/

It also might be available at:
   ftp://pluto.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgi/cgiwrap
   ftp://ftp.rollanet.org/pub/cgi/cgiwrap

Other CGI scripts I have written, and some scripts that have been 
modified to work with cgiwrap more easily are available from:
   ftp://ftp.cc.umr.edu/pub/cgi

More information, and some sample user instructions on how to use cgiwrap
are available at:
