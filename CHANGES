Changes since 2.6:
   Added HTTPD_USER and CHECK_HTTPD_USER to verify that cgiwrap is being
   	called by the server. This is for (access to scripts) security, it 
	doesn't affect system security any. 
   Added AFS PAG support

Changes since 2.5:
   Moved rlimit call into new subroutine SetLimits
   Changed exec call to an execv and passed argv to support argument passing
	This will only work correctly for scripts called with no other 
	arguments... Eg, must use "cgiwrap/user/script?" syntax
