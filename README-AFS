CGIwrap will work with AFS, with at least the following permissions:

~           system:anyuser l
public_html system:anyuser l
cgi-bin     system:anyuser rl

The scripts need to be executable by the user

If you are running httpd authenticated to AFS, you can replace the 
system:anyuser above with that userid

If you are using this with AFS I'd suggest making sure to use the AFS PAG 
support in the config file. This automatically creates a PAG for any 
script that is launched, that way if the user klog's or something, it 
won't affect the server or other scripts.
