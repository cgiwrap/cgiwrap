CGIwrap will work with AFS, with at least the following permissions:

~           system:anyuser l
public_html system:anyuser l
cgi-bin     system:anyuser rl

The scripts need to be executable by the user

If you are running httpd authenticated to AFS, you can replace the 
system:anyuser above with that userid
